# I

My name is Simon Troy Cosgrove.

This repository contains vital and personal information about myself (omitting information only when it comes to 3rd parties)

The reasoning for this is purely because in all of history those who have attempted to achieve things have done so mostly by obfuscating either themselves, their past, or their future plans.

By allowing myself to be inspected I hope to prove my drive, focus, and goal

I'm aware that this will open me up to being a target but in this day and age, who isn't one?

I act as founder of this organization but I do not wish to lay claim to anything other than the desire to present an organizational template that helps others.

## tl;dr
This is how I choose to love my fellow human.
